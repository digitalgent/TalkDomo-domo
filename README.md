Digitalent - Speech To Text (STT) / Text To Speech (TTS)

In order to explain how STT ans TTS work we'll be using the Web Speech API.

## Web Speech API
The Web Speech API has two parts: SpeechRecognition (Speech-to-Text - STT) and SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech - TTS).

Also check [mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) to learn more about it.

## Note
Not all browser support `Web Speech API` thus it's recommend the use of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).
